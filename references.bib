  abstract = "In this paper, we review the empirical literature pertaining to
              the effectiveness of instructions and movement demonstrations.
              Initially, we examine existing theories and approaches that try
              to explain the process of skill acquisition so as to determine
              implications of these theories for instructional provision. This
              is followed by an evaluation of studies in the motor learning
              literature in which pre-practice information has been
              manipulated. Explicit learning strategies are contrasted to
              implicit and discovery learning methods, and current explanations
              for instructional effects are discussed in terms of such
              mechanisms as effects-related attentional focus and movement
              variability. In the final sections, we review data from our own
              laboratory where pre-practice information has been manipulated
              during the learning of a novel bimanual coordination task. From
              these studies, proposals are made to try and explain how
              pre-practice information works to effect the process of skill
              acquisition, including the selection and execution of a response
              and the processing of associated feedback. An important role is
              given to the existing skills of the learner in understanding the
              instructions and performing the desired movement. Finally, we
              suggest some practical implications of this empirical evidence

  abstract = "``Slacklining'' represents a modern sports activity where people
              have to keep balance on a tightened ribbon. The first trials on
              the slackline result in uncontrollable lateral swing of the
              supporting leg. Training decreases those oscillations and
              therefore improves postural control. However, the underlying
              neural mechanisms are not known. Therefore, the present study
              aimed to highlight spinal adaptations going along with slackline
              training. Twenty-four subjects were either assigned to a training
              or a control group and postural control was assessed before and
              after the 10 training sessions. Additionally, soleus Hoffmann
              (H)-reflexes were elicited to evaluate changes in the
              excitability of the spinal reflex circuitry. Trained subjects
              were able to maintain balance on the slackline for at least 20 s
              (P<0.001) and reduced platform movements on the balance board
              (P<0.05). The H-reflexes were significantly diminished (P<0.05)
              while no changes occurred in the background electromyography
              (bEMG). The control group showed no significant changes. From a
              functional point of view the reflex reduction may serve to
              suppress uncontrollable reflex mediated joint oscillations. As
              the bEMG remained unchanged, presynaptic rather than
              post-synaptic mechanisms are speculated to be responsible for the
              changes in the Ia-afferent transmission.",

              of game-based virtual reality (VR) therapy as a mean of
              correcting postural and co-ordination abnormalities in
              individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Therapy was done
              with interactive customized VR games and scenarios, utilizing an
              Xbox Kinect sensor. RESEARCH DESIGN: The study was a pilot
              project using the structure of a phase II clinical trial. METHODS
              AND PROCEDURES: Fifteen participants with mild-to-moderate
              chronic TBI-related balance and motor co-ordination impairments
              participated in 15 sessions, each lasting ∼50-55 minutes,
              scheduled 2-3 times a week over 5-6 consecutive weeks.
              Participants were evaluated at baseline, immediately after the
              final session and in a 1-month follow-up with a battery of
              clinical tests (measuring postural stability, gait and
              co-ordination) and movement performance parameters. Movement
              parameters included arm-leg co-ordination, dynamic stability and
              arm precision, calculated from kinematic data recorded with Xbox
              Kinect sensor. RESULTS: Following therapy, most participants
              improved their static and dynamic postural stability, gait and
              arm movements. These effects persisted over the retention
              interval. CONCLUSIONS: Results will be used to improve the VR
              program, with the goal of producing a cost-effective, accessible
              and easy to individualize therapeutic approach. The pilot data
              will be used for designing a larger scale clinical trial.",

              participated in the study and were assigned to either a training
              or a control group. The training group completed a 4-week
              training program on slacklines, while the control group received

  abstract = "The risk of falling increases significantly in the elderly
              because of deterioration of the neural musculature regulatory
              mechanisms. Several studies have investigated methods of
              preventing falling using real-time systems to evaluate balance;
              however, it is difficult to monitor the results of such
              characterizations in real time. Herein, we describe the use of
              Microsoft's Kinect depth sensor system to evaluate balance in
              real time. Six healthy male adults (25.5$\pm$1.8 years,
              173.9$\pm$6.4 cm, 71.4$\pm$6.5 kg, and 23.6$\pm$2.4 kg/m(2)),
              with normal balance abilities and with no musculoskeletal
              disorders, were selected to participate in the experiment.
              Movements of the participants were induced by controlling the
              base plane of the balance training equipment in various
              directions. The dynamic motion of the subjects was measured using
              two Kinect depth sensor systems and a three-dimensional motion
              capture system with eight infrared cameras. The two systems
              yielded similar results for changes in the center of body mass
              (P>0.05) with a large Pearson's correlation coefficient of
              $\gamma$>0.60. The results for the two systems showed similarity
              in the mean lower-limb joint angle with flexion-extension
              movements, and these values were highly correlated (hip joint:
              within approximately 4.6°; knee joint: within approximately 8.4°)
              (0.400.05). Large differences with a low correlation were,
              however, observed for the lower-limb joint angle in relation to
              abduction-adduction and internal-external rotation motion
              ($\gamma$<0.40) (P<0.05). These findings show that clinical and
              dynamic accuracy can be achieved using the Kinect system in
              balance training by measuring changes in the center of body mass
              and flexion-extension movements of the lower limbs, but not

              Deficits in postural control/muscle strength represent important

              investigate the impact of a specific type of balance training, i.
              e. slackline training, followed by detraining on balance and
              strength performance. Twenty-seven adults participated in this
              study and were assigned to an intervention (age 22.8$\pm$3.3 yrs)
              or a control group (age 23.9$\pm$4.4 yrs). The intervention group
              participated in 4 weeks of slackline training on nylon webbings.
              Detraining lasted 4 weeks. Tests included the measurement of (A)
              total centre of pressure displacements during one-legged standing
              on a balance platform and during the compensation of a
              perturbation impulse, (B) maximal torque and rate of force

              static/dynamic postural control, maximal torque, and jumping
              height. Training-induced improvements were found for RFD. After
              the withdrawal of the training stimulus, RFD slightly decreased.
              Given that the promotion of balance and strength is important for
              injury prevention, changes in RFD only might not be sufficient to
              produce an injury-preventive effect.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Adequate static and dynamic balance performance is an
              important prerequisite during daily and sporting life. Various
              traditional and innovative balance training concepts have been
              suggested to improve postural control or neuromuscular fall risk
              profiles over recent years. Whether slackline training (balancing
              over narrow nylon ribbons) serves as an appropriate training
              strategy to improve static and dynamic balance performance is as
              yet unclear. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to examine the occurrence and
              magnitude of effects of slackline training compared with an
              inactive control condition on static and dynamic balance
              performance parameters in children, adults and seniors. DATA
              SOURCES: Five biomedical and psychological databases (CINAHL,
              EMBASE, ISI Web of Knowledge, PubMed, SPORTDiscus) were screened
              using the following search terms with Boolean conjunctions:

              floppy wir* OR rop* balanc* OR ropedanc* OR rope-danc*) STUDY
              SELECTION: Randomized and non-randomized controlled trials that
              applied slackline training as an exercise intervention compared
              with an inactive control condition focusing on static and dynamic
              balance performance (perturbed and non-perturbed single leg
              stance) in healthy children, adults and seniors were screened for
              eligibility. DATA EXTRACTION: Eligibility and study quality
              [Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale] were
              independently assessed by two researchers. Standardized mean
              differences (SMDs) calculated as weighted Hedges' g served as
              main outcomes in order to compare slackline training versus
              inactive control on slackline standing as well as dynamic and
              static balance performance parameters. Statistical analyses were
              conducted using a random-effects, inverse-variance model.
              RESULTS: Eight trials (mean PEDro score 6.5 $\pm$ 0.9) with 204
              healthy participants were included. Of the included subjects, 35
              \% were children or adolescents, 39 \% were adults and 26 \% were
              seniors. Slackline training varied from 4 to 6 weeks with 16
              $\pm$ 7 training sessions on average, ranging from 8 to 28
              sessions. Mean overall slackline training covered 380 $\pm$ 128
              min. Very large task-specific effects in favor of slackline
              training compared with the inactive control condition were found
              for slackline standing time \{SMD 4.63 [95 \% confidence interval
              (CI) 3.67-5.59], p < 0.001\}. Small and moderate pooled transfer
              effects were observed for dynamic [SMD 0.52 (95 \% CI 0.08-0.96),
              p = 0.02] and static [SMD 0.30 (95 \% CI -0.03 to 0.64), p =
              0.07] standing balance performance, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
              Slackline training mainly revealed meaningful task-specific
              training effects in balance performance tasks that are closely
              related to the training content, such as slackline standing time
              and dynamic standing balance. Transfer effects to static and
              dynamic standing balance performance tasks are limited. As a
              consequence, slackline devices should be embedded into a
              challenging and multimodal balance training program and not used
              as the sole form of training.",
